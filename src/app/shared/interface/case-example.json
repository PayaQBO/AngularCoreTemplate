The Hogwashes made there fortune in the eighteenth century owning a plantation on the remote pacific island of Tunga Wonga. However since then a long line of gambling caused the family fortune to dwindle. I take after these ancestors. \n My cousin lives on the plantation on Tunga Wonga. Recently a foreign power has started dumping nuclear fuel on the island. Since this began, the local \"pungent pumpkins\", have been behaving strangely. Knowing my botanic interest, mu cousin sent me some pumpkins to experiment with. Their properties were so astounding, I quickly realised that they had phenomenal commercial potential and I sent them to the famous scientist Professor Emmelius Bunsen to investigate properly. The end result has been that the Hogwashes now earn their entire income from importing pungent pumpkins form Tunga Wonga and selling the to the Pungent Pumpkin Processing Company.",

I sell these pumpkins to the Pungent Pumpkin Processing Company, and am therefore their Chief Pumpkin Supply Agent. I did not much like Clifton. I do not feel he paid me a fair price for my pumpkins. And neither did I like his personal habits – he was always scratching between his toes!"

The textile industry remains my first love, and I am excited by anything that remotely involves cloth manufacturing. \n Sir Hamish Hogwash sent me some Pungent Pumpkins to dissect and experiment with. I was astonished by the results. This amazing vegetable has diverse and fantastic properties and I have used them to produce an abundant range of products, all with",

I assume that his shares will now come to me. With Clifton having all the business expertise and commercial knowledge, I sometimes felt a little overshadowed by my step-brother. But I am sincerely sorry that he is dead."

I have a passion for fast cars, the high life, and beautiful women. \n My step-brother, Professor Emmelius Bunsen, asked for my help in setting up a commercial concern to develop and sell products made from the Pungent Pumpkin. I leapt at the chance to help him out. However my step-brother and I could only contribute a certain amount to the financing of the business, and so we need a backer to assist us. \n Fortunately I have been building up relationship with Lady Fading, a mature society beauty who also happens to be a wealthy divorcee. She agreed to help finance our business. I am now Managing Director of the Pungent Pumpkin Processing Company and I own 24% of the company shares."

Recently a foreign power has started dumping nuclear fuel on the island. Since this began, the local \"pungent pumpkins\", have been behaving strangely. Knowing my botanic interest, mu cousin sent me some pumpkins to experiment with. Their properties were so astounding, I quickly realised that they had phenomenal commercial potential and I sent them to the famous scientist Professor Emmelius Bunsen to investigate properly. The end result has been that the Hogwashes now earn their entire income from importing pungent pumpkins form Tunga Wonga and selling the to the Pungent Pumpkin Processing Company.",

I sell these pumpkins to the Pungent Pumpkin Processing Company, and am therefore their Chief Pumpkin Supply Agent. I did not much like Clifton. I do not feel he paid me a fair price for my pumpkins. And neither did I like his personal habits – he was always scratching between his toes!"
